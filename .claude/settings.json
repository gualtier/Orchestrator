If yes, verify that BOTH of these were run afterward:\n   - 'update-memory --full' (or update-memory with --full flag)\n   - 'learn extract'\n\nRespond {\"ok\": false, \"reason\": \"...\"} if:\n- Commits were made without update-memory AND without manual PROJECT_MEMORY.md edits, OR\n- Merge was run without 'update-memory --full' and 'learn extract'\n\nRespond {\"ok\": true} if:\n- Input field 'stop_hook_active' is true, OR\n- No commits/merges were made, OR\n- All required follow-up commands were run, OR\n- PROJECT_MEMORY.md was manually edited as part of the committed changes"
