# Project Constitution

> Immutable principles governing the transformation of specs into code.
> Inspired by GitHub Spec-Kit SDD. Fully customizable per project.

## Article I - Research-First
No technical decisions without documented research. Investigate before you decide.

## Article II - Test-First
No implementation code before tests are written and validated.

## Article III - Simplicity
Maximum 3 modules in initial implementation. No over-engineering.

## Article IV - Direct Usage
Use framework features directly. No unnecessary wrappers or abstractions.

## Article V - Integration Testing
Tests with real environments (databases, services). Mocks only when unavoidable.

## Article VI - Spec Traceability
All code must be traceable to a requirement in the spec. No "just in case" code.

## Amendments
